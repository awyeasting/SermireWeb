		<h1>The Home of Book Discussion</h1>
		<p>
		Sermire is the home for all online book discussion. We believe diverse perspectives enrich our enjoyment of our lives and make the world a more connected, empathetic, and caring place for everyone. Along with this, we believe that many great books can be excellent tools for the development of individuals. Towards that end we want to provide a public, free to use platform for all discussion.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Have localized discussions</h2>
		<p>The first feature of the site is a sticker based book discussion system. Simply put one of our discrete QR code stickers on the back of the inside cover of any book. The first time you visit the site using that QR code you will be prompted to identify the book the sticker is on using our dynamic database of possible books. Then get right to posting.</p>
		<p>If you have a lot of books laying around that you have loved, but you want to make giving them away more rewarding, our site is perfect for your needs. We believe in reducing waste and reusing books. With this system if you have a book you love reading, put a sticker on it and give it to your friend to read and post about. They can then pass it on further and using our site you can see the people your book has touched.</p>
		<p>Right now this site is in its infancy, so we are printing a limited number of stickers. If you’re interested in this idea, shoot us an email with the subject line, “Sermire Stickers” at <span class="email-text">awyeasting@gmail.com</span> and we’ll be happy to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>(Future) Have in-depth book discussions</h2>
		<p>Currently we are developing a system of aggregating and sorting posts on book copies to feature a general book discussion forum. This forum will be completely public and searchable on site so that you don’t have to find a book with a sticker in order to interact in the discourse on the best books.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h2>(Future) Find interesting book groups</h2>
		<p>After we complete our general book discussion pages our plan is to immediately get to work on a book group matchmaking service. This service will pair you with other readers on the fly to build unique book groups where you can truly expand your horizons. As readers we love the engagement in the material offered by book groups, but we also like to hear genuinely new voices every time.</p>
